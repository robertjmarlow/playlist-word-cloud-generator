Tim Finnegan lived in Walkin Street A gentle Irishman mighty odd He had a brogue both rich and sweet An' to rise in the world he carried a hod You see he'd a sort of a tipplers way But the love for the liquor poor Tim was born To help him on his way each day He'd a drop of the craythur every morn [Chorus:] Whack fol the dah now dance to yer Partner around the flure yer trotters shake Wasn't it the truth I told you? Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake One morning Tim got rather full His head felt heavy which made him shake Fell from a ladder and he broke his skull And they carried him home his corpse to wake Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet And laid him out upon the bed A bottle of whiskey at his feet And a barrel of porter at his head [Chorus] His friends assembled at the wake And Mrs Finnegan called for lunch First she brought in tay and cake Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch Biddy O'Brien began to cry "Such a nice clean corpse, did you ever see Tim avourneen, why did you die?" "Will ye hould your gob?" said Paddy McGee [Chorus] Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job "Biddy" says she "you're wrong, I'm sure" Biddy gave her a belt in the Gob and left her sprawling on the floor Then the war did soon engage T'was woman to woman and man to man Shillelagh law was all the rage And a row and a ruction soon began [Chorus] Mickey Maloney ducked his head when A bucket of whiskey flew at him It missed, and falling on the bed The liquor scattered over Tim Bedad he revives, see how he rises Timothy rising from the bed Saying "Whittle your whiskey around Like blazes, t'underin' Jaysus, do ye think I'm dead?" [Chorus]
Have you heard about the big strong man? He lived in a caravan Have you heard about the Jeffries-Johnson fight? Oh, what a hell of a fight You can take all the heavyweights you got We've got a lad who will beat the whole lot He used to ring the bells in the belfry, now he's gonna fight Jack Dempsey [Chorus] He was my brother Sylvest (What's he got?) A row of forty medals on his chest, big chest Killed fifty badmen in the West He knows no rest Bigger the man, hell's fire Don't push, just shove, plenty of room for you and me He's got an arm like a leg And a punch that would sink a battleship, big ship Takes all the army and the navy To put the wind up Sylvest Well, he thought he'd take a trip to Italy And he thought that he'd go by sea He jumped off the harbour in New York And he swam like a man made of cork He saw the Lusitania in distress (What'd he do?) He put the Lusitania on his chest, big chest Drank all the water in the sea And he walked all the way to Italy [Chorus] That was my brother Sylvest (What's he got?) A row of forty medals on his chest, big chest Killed fifty badmen in the west He knows no rest Bigger the man, hell's fire Don't push, just shove, plenty of room for you and me Well he thought he'd take a trip to old Japan And they turned out the whole brass band He played every instrument they got Like a lad, sure he beat the whole lot Now the old church bells will ring (Hell's bells!) The old church choir will sing (Hell's choir!) They all turned out to say farewell To my big brother Sylvest [Chorus] That was my brother Sylvest (What's he got?) A row of forty medals on his chest, big chest Killed fifty badmen in the west He knows no rest Bigger the man, hell's fire Don't push, just shove, plenty of room for you and me He's got an arm like a leg And a punch that would sink a battleship, big ship Takes all the army and the navy To put the wind up Sylvest
